### Open questions
1. Do we have any data points which suggest that the page rank is low because some pages are not aligned with the query users are issuing?
2. Wouldn't semantic clustering be a faster approach to understand if content of rental pages are aligned to the user queries? If we consider each listing page as a document and perform a clustering activity, we would understand that how similar or different these documents are from each other, if we have clear clusters then we don't have to rate every document, we just need to focus of the few distincet clusters. This activity might be completely futile but worth attempting.
